# Git Lesson

Covers the basics of using git for version control

To make a commit("version" or "checkpoint") of your files, follow this procedure

1. Make changes to your project that you would like to keep

2. When you have your changes, tell git you are ready to create a checkpoint of the files by using `git add filename`

3. Create a checkpoint using `git commit -m "message about what you changed"`

## adding features
Features should be developed on branches. To create and switch to a branch, use the command `git switch -c new_branch_name`

To switch to an existing branch, use `git switch bramnch name`
